# DSM_KAP_SimAnimation
Animation script for matlab for results of simulations of multi-body kinetic system as seen in the course Dynamics of Mechanical Systems at IST
## This is a Beta version with bugs and missing documentation
More info will follow soon...
# How to use
Start with START_HERE.m, set the configuration there.
### how to load the simulation results: 
1. use "import data" feature of matlab, chose *.* (All files) in file
type, then chose your *.PLT output file. 
2. Import it as numerical matrix, set the table title (=variable name) to
plt, then save the variable plt in a *.mat file by right click
then load them in START_HERE.m with load('YourExportedPLTVariable.mat');

It should work with any model input file in the format specified in the semester project description of DSM, and its corresponding  \*.PLT simulation output file, generated by KAP.EXE or your own program.
